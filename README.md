*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: PAWAN KUMAR SHARMA

*INTERN ID*: CT04DZ1961

*DOMAIN*: JAVA PROGRAMMING

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK*:-

1. Objective of the Task:-
   --> To design and implement a File Handling Utility in Java.
   --> This utility should perform three operations: write, read, and modify text files.
   --> Provide a simple menu-driven program for the user.

2. What I Performed in the Task:-
   --> Created methods for different operations using Java I/O classes.
     1. Write Operation: Used BufferedWriter and FileWriter to create a text file with the content provided by the user.
     2. Read Operation: Used BufferedReader and FileReader to read the file content and display it.
     3. Modify Operation: It add new content into the file without deleting existing data.
    --> Implemented a menu-driven interface in the main method with options for each operation and an exit option.
    --> Added exception handling (try-catch) to manage errors like missing files or I/O failures.
    --> Tested the program with different inputs to ensure correct functionality of reading, writing and modifying operations.

3. IDE Used:-
    --> Developed te project using Eclipse IDE, a widely used environment for Java Development.
    --> Eclipse features such as code completion, debugging tools, and project management made the task easier.
    --> The integrated console in Eclipse helped in testing the interactive menu-driven program.

5. Applications of this Task:-
    --> Can be used to store and retrieve student details or employee records.
    --> Reading and writing text-based configuration files for applications.
    --> Helps beginners nderstand Java I/O streams and file handling concepts, which are foundations for larger projects.
    --> Useful for small-scale storage where databases are not required (like maintaining notes, to-do lists, or small text-based databases).

7. Learning Outcomes:-
    --> Gained hands-on practicewith Java File I/O classes (FileWriter, BufferedWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader).
    --> Learned the importance of exception handling.
    --> Learned how to implement interactive menu-driven program in Java language.
    --> Experienced how to build an interactive console appication in Java.
    --> Enchanced problem-solving and debugging skills by using Eclipse IDE.

8. Conclusion:-
     --> Successfully developed a File Handling Utility that can read, write, and modify text files.
     --> Learned practical applications of file operations and how they are relevant in real-world scenarios.
     --> Strengthened understanding of Java I/O and gained exposure to concepts that can be scaled to larger, more complex projects.
