# File-Handling-Utility

*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: PAWAN KUMAR SHARMA

*INTERN ID*: CT04DZ1961

*DOMAIN*: JAVA PROGRAMMING

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK*:-

1. Objective of the Task:-
   --> The main objective of this task is to design and implement a File Handling Utility in Java.
   --> This utility should able to perform three core file operations: writing, reading, and modifying text files.
   --> Another important objective was to make the program simple, interactive, and user-friendly by implementing a menu-driven interface where the user could select operations directly from the console.

2. What I Performed in the Task:-
   --> Created dedicated methods for different operations using Java I/O classes:- 
     1. Write Operation: Implementd using BufferedWriter and FileWriter. This allows the program to create a new text file with the content provided by the user.
     2. Read Operation: Implementd using BufferedReader and FileReader. The program reads the file content line by line and display it on the console.
     3. Modify Operation: Implemented by opening the file in append mode using FileWriter(true). It add new content into the file without deleting existing data. 
    --> Implemented a menu-driven interface in the main() method with options for each operation (Write, Read, Modify) and an exit option. This make program more user-friendly and easy to test.
    --> Added exception handling (try-catch) to manage errors like missing files or I/O failures.
    --> Tested the program with different inputs to ensure correct functionality of reading, writing and modifying operations.

3. IDE Used:-
    --> Developed te project using Eclipse IDE, a widely used environment for Java Development.
    --> Eclipse features such as code completion, debugging tools, and project management made the task easier.
    --> The integrated console in Eclipse helped in testing the interactive menu-driven program.

5. Applications of this Task:-
    --> Can be used to store and retrieve student details or employee records.
    --> Reading and writing text-based configuration files for applications.
    --> Useful for creating and maintaining application logs, error logs, or usage history in software systems.
    --> Helps beginners nderstand Java I/O streams and file handling concepts, which are foundations for larger projects.
    --> Useful for small-scale storage where databases are not required (like maintaining notes, to-do lists, or small text-based databases).

7. Learning Outcomes:-
    --> Gained hands-on practicewith Java File I/O classes (FileWriter, BufferedWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader).
    --> Learned the importance of exception handling to make programs more reliable and fault tolerant.
    --> Learned how to implement interactive menu-driven program in Java language.
    --> Experienced how to build an interactive console appication in Java.
    --> Enchanced problem-solving and debugging skills by using Eclipse IDE.

8. Conclusion:-
     --> Successfully developed a File Handling Utility that can read, write, and modify text files.
     --> Learned practical applications of file operations and how they are relevant in real-world scenarios.
     --> Strengthened understanding of Java I/O and gained exposure to concepts that can be scaled to larger, more complex projects.
